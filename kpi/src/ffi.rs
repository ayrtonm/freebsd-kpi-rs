/// A struct containing a base class `B` followed by extra fields `F`.

/// This type assumes the base class is shared with C code and is primarily intended to be used for
/// interfacing with existing KPIs which require a subclass of a C type. If that is not necessary
/// this type should be avoided.
///
/// `SubClass<B, F>` has a `Deref<Target = F>` impl to allow using it like an `F`. For example if
/// `F` is a struct with fields named `foo` and `bar`, a subclass allows transparently accessing
/// them using `my_subclass.foo` and `my_subclass.bar`.
///
/// Accessing the base class fields requires using the [`base!`] macro which uses C-like syntax for
/// reading, writing and getting the address of fields.
///
/// ```
/// let baz_addr: *mut BazTy = base!(&my_subclass->baz);
/// let old_baz_value = unsafe { base!(my_subclass->baz) };
/// unsafe { base!(my_subclass->baz) = new_baz_value; };
///
/// ```
///
/// For example if `B` is a struct with a field named `baz`, a subclass allows getting its address using `base!(&my_subclass->baz)` and accessing it using `unsafe { base!(my_subclass->baz) = baz_value };` or
/// `let baz_value = unsafe { base!(my_subclass->baz) };`. Since the base class is assumed to be
/// shared with C code it requires the user to manually ensure that the field is not being accessed
/// concurrently by other threads.
